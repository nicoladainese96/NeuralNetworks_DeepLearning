# NeuralNetworks_DeepLearning
Repository that will contain my projects for the course of Neural Networks and Deep Learning attended in 2019 at University of Padua.

## Ex1: Implementing a Neural Network in numpy
In this work I present my implementation of a Neural Network (NN) with two layers and a framework (grid search) to search systematically for the best architecture and hyper-parameters (HPs) between some possible options defined with some a priori knowledge and heuristics. Finally I present the best model found and its performance on a simple dataset.

The pourpose of the project is to understand the complexity of building a deep learning framework, so that once one will start to use frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch will have more insights on their functioning.
